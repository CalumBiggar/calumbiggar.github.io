The primary goal of maintaining this website it to continue to hone my skills as an embedded developer, giving myself a place I can document and organise what I have learned from the time I spend exploring relevant topics. Using the tried and tested "learning by doing" mantra, I hope to continue to push my skills and knowledge to the next level.

My main focus will be improving my development process, so expect to see topics that include (but are not limited to!), the following:
    - Automated testing
        - Unit testing
        - Integration testing
        - etc
    - Streamlining the build process and environment
    - Software development planning and implementation
        - Including virtualisation

The target audience for this website is... future me!

But if you happen to stumble across this website, you're more than welcome to have a look around :)
